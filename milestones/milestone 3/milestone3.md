milestone3.md contains screenshots of your latest UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file.
milestone3.md contains a written explanation of how your UI skeleton screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone2.md in a noticeable way.
You show your TA how your UI skeletons improved in a noticeable way from what you showed them during Milestone 3 grading session. (During your in-person grading session, show your milestone2.md to compare to your old screenshots.)
You explain to your TA what database or data API you chose, and why you chose it.
You successfully live demo at least one Ajax interaction where your TA can trigger some action on one of your webpages, it fetches some data from a backend database or external data API, and then displays that data directly on your webpage without reloading it. You don't need to display the data in any fancy visual way; a simple text-based display is fine at this point. (2 points)
Your database or external data API functionality is relevant to your project (in other words, it's not just directly copied from Professor Guo's example code without meaningful modifications).
You can confirm that your project is not simply using data from a text file (such as a .csv or .json file) or hard-coding objects into your JavaScript code.
You can properly use the Network Inspector tab in your web browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to show your TA exactly what data is being passed between the frontend and backend (or external web API) during these Ajax interactions. (2 points)
You can properly explain to your TA how your database or external data API interaction works in detail by walking through the code that you wrote for it, both in your frontend and backend. (3 points)
You tell your TA a plausible plan for how you are going to meaningfully display or visualize the data on the frontend for future milestones. You don't need to necessarily stick with this plan, but you must at least propose a plan.


Written Explanation:

	Our UI has been completely redone using a bootstrap theme we found to be thematically relevant to our concept. Additionally, there's a lot more place for new functionalities which we have not yet implemented, but now have the framework to do so later in the project. We added an API call to one of the buttons that dynamically loads a map object on click, and are working on loading a list of markers that show up on said map object using an AJAX call.
