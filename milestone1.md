Milestone 1 (due Monday 4/22 at 11:59pm)

1. Your team name (please pick something memorable but family-friendly and appropriate)

2. Team members: Rubaiat Tazim, Warren Chen, Will Knox. 

3. At least a one-paragraph project proposal describing your team's project idea:
  a. In this paragraph you should clearly describe your app's target user population and why it fits the project theme. Most importantly,      you need to mention why none of your team members are part of the target user population.
  b. You should also mention what possible sources of real-world data or APIs you might use. (You're not bound by these choices; you can        always change these later.)
  c. Feel free to write down several ideas if you want more feedback from your TA. Only 1 idea is required to get credit, but we suggest        several if you are unsure of whether they fall within scope of this course's requirements. Your TA will give you feedback on all your 
     proposed ideas.

4. Storyboards and paper prototypes
