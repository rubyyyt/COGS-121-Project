COGS 121 Milestone 2

How our idea is different from Milestone 1:
Our benefactors are still philanthropists, but we changed our beneficiaries from those in need (which was too broad) to public schools. Also, in order to narrow down our focus group of public schools, we have the option to filter by location. We also changed our API to Google Maps so that we can find information on public schools determined by location. We may also include tags to filter results even more.
