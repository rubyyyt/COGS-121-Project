milestone5.md is present in your project's GitHub repository.
milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing how someone in your target user population would use your app in order to help them achieve relevant goals. Think of this as a storyboard (setting+sequence+satisfaction) except written in a paragraph instead of using drawings. (2 points)
milestone5.md contains screenshots of your latest UI webpages embedded directly within the file.
milestone5.md contains a written explanation of how your UI's screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone4.md.
milestone5.md contains screenshots of how your data is displayed or visualized within your app. Include these as separate screenshots in addition to the general UI screenshots in rubric item 2. (You don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)
milestone5.md contains a written explanation of how you implemented your data display or visualizations, such as which libraries/frameworks you used (if any), how you hooked up to data APIs or databases, etc. (Again, you don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.) (2 points)
milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel free to be more creative here. (2 points)
You can show your TA that the data that is displayed in your app's frontend are powered by real data and not simply mock-up fake data or snippets from example code (2 points).
You can walk through all the code you wrote to implement your data display or rendering, and explain how it works at a high level (2 points).
You successfully walk through all of the major functionality of your app so far by demoing in-person to your TA (2 points).
During your walk through demo, your TA will now play the role of a new user seeing your demo for the first time; you can successfully answer questions they ask from the perspective of a complete novice who doesn't know your app at all (e.g., imagine showing it to some random person at a coffee shop) (2 points).
Your demo and TA questions do not reveal any major bugs or pieces of obvious missing functionality (it's OK if there are small minor bugs, you will get full credit here as long as it mostly works) (2 points).

WriteUp:

	Our screenshots have improved in that they
	
	Our first non-trivial function is loading a map, which then outputs a list of schools nearby in clickable fields below the map. Each of these fields is a link to the school's page, where information about the school and the option to "donate" will be included (not yet implemented)
	Our second non-trivial function is searching a database based on user input, which returns a single link to a school if there is a match in the database.
