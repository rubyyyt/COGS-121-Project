Team Name: !!! (Bang Bang Bang)

Members: Rubaiat Tazim, Warren Chen, Will Knox

Contributions: In each milestone, we changed up our roles a bit depending on what we wanted to learn and improve on, and towards the end more based on our strengths. Will and Rubaiat worked mostly on the backend at first because we needed the most work on those skills. Will worked on connecting the Google maps API to our app while Rubaiat worked on connecting Firebase to it on the registration page. Warren did most of the front=end work and decided which UI our app should use. Towards the last few weeks of the quarter, we changed our roles and Warren worked more on the backend as well so that he could put to use the skills he had learned in the class.
